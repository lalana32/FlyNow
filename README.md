## üîß Technologies Used

### Backend (C# / .NET 9 ‚Äî Microservices)

- **.NET 9** ‚Äî latest version of the .NET platform
- **Entity Framework Core 9**
- **ASP.NET Identity + JWT Authentication**
- **RabbitMQ** ‚Äî for asynchronous, decoupled communication between services
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äî primary database for services
- **YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy)** ‚Äî reverse proxy and gateway
- **Swashbuckle / Swagger** ‚Äî for API documentation and testing

**Core Microservices:**
- `AuthService` ‚Äî Handles user authentication, authorization, and JWT token issuance
- `EmailService` ‚Äî Sends transactional emails (e.g., registration, password reset)
- `FlightService` ‚Äî Manages flight search, itineraries, and seat availability
- `YarpProxy` ‚Äî Reverse proxy that routes all frontend and external traffic to the appropriate backend service

---

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

- **React 19 + TypeScript**
- **Vite** ‚Äî ultra-fast build tool
- **Material UI 7** ‚Äî responsive and elegant UI components
- **React Router v7** ‚Äî declarative client-side routing
- **React Hook Form** ‚Äî performant form state management
- **Redux Toolkit** ‚Äî state management made simple and scalable
- **TanStack Query (React Query)** ‚Äî powerful data-fetching and caching layer
- **Axios** ‚Äî API communication layer
- **React Icons**, **React-to-PDF**, **Lodash.debounce**, and more

## üê≥ Infrastructure & Docker

The application runs fully containerized using **Docker Compose**.

| Service       | Port (Local) | Description                         |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| YARP Proxy    | `5000`       | Reverse proxy for all backend APIs  |
| AuthService   | `5001`       | Handles authentication & tokens     |
| EmailService  | `5002`       | Responsible for sending emails      |
| PostgreSQL    | `5433`       | Relational database                 |
| RabbitMQ      | `15672` (UI), `5672` | Message broker for microservice communication |

Each service is independently deployable and communicates via REST and RabbitMQ. Health checks and wait-for scripts ensure safe startup order.
